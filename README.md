# ascii_flask

Rewriting ASCII Generator using Flask because it turns out there's less boiletplate code, which == less files to submit üëç

The final project for my university Python class, this is a simple webpage powered by ~~Beaker~~ Flask.

The frontend is a simple form with a text field and a submit button, the latter of which calls an API endpoint to display an ASCII art representation of what the user (probably you) typed. Just like ‚ú® magic ‚ú®

# Setup

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The alphabet database is included in the aptly-named `alphabet.db`

# Start-up
